<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>


(Create Resources)
Create a Resource Group and a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)

(Observe ICMP Traffic)
Using Remote Desktop to connect to Windows 10 Virtual Machine



(Observe SSH Traffic)
in Wireshark, filter for SSH traffic only


(Observe DHCP Traffic)
Back in Wireshark, filter for DHCP traffic only

(Observe DNS Traffic)
Back in Wireshark, filter for DNS traffic only

 (Observe RDP Traffic)
Back in Wireshark, filter for RDP traffic only (tcp.port == 3389)
